## Brain, Neurons, and Models
#### This code effectively simulates a basic McCulloch-Pitts neuron, showing how it processes input and generates a binary output based on the given threshold and weights. This forms a fundamental part of neural network computations
## Softmax
#### Softmax is a mathematical function commonly used in the field of machine learning and deep learning, particularly in classification problems. It's a type of squashing function that transforms a vector of raw scores (often called logits) into probabilities by taking the exponential of each element and then normalizing these values by dividing by the sum of all these exponentials. This process ensures that the output probabilities range between 0 and 1 and sum up to 1, making them interpretable as the probabilities that the input belongs to each possible class.
