# Neural-Networks-and-AI
#### A neural network is a model inspired by how the brain works. It consists of multiple layers having many activations, this activation resembles neurons of our brain. A neural network tries to learn a set of parameters in a set of data which could help to recognize the underlying relationships. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
## Brain, Neurons, and Models
#### This code effectively simulates a basic McCulloch-Pitts neuron, showing how it processes input and generates a binary output based on the given threshold and weights. This forms a fundamental part of neural network computations

## Creating a simple Perceptron-based neural network for handwritten digit recognition.

#### Prepare Grayscale Images: You need to generate a dataset of grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. These images should be 20 x 20 pixels in size and should vary slightly to account for different writing styles. This dataset will serve as the training data for your Perceptron.

#### Prepare Test Images: Apart from the training dataset, you should also create some test images that are not labeled. These images will be used to evaluate the performance of your trained Perceptron once it's ready.

#### Develop Perceptron Software: You will need to develop software to implement the Perceptron-based neural network. This software should include the following components:

#### Initialization Module: A module to set the initial values of the transmission matrix (weights) and bias.
#### Activation Function: Implement the sigmoid activation function, which is commonly used in Perceptrons.
#### Loss Function: Create a loss function that quantifies the error between the predicted and actual labels during training.
#### Forward Propagation: Implement the forward pass, where input data is passed through the Perceptron to produce an output.
#### Backpropagation: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights and bias based on the error and update them to minimize the loss.
#### Gradient Descent: Implement the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the weights and bias during training.
#### Modularity: Ensure that the software is modular and allows for easy swapping of datasets, activation functions, and other parameters for future experimentation.
#### Initialize Parameters: Initialize the transmission matrix (weights) and bias with suitable initial values. Random initialization is common in neural networks.

#### Train and Test: Use the training dataset to train your Perceptron by iteratively adjusting the weights and bias using the gradient descent algorithm. After training, evaluate the performance of your Perceptron using the test images to see how well it can recognize handwritten digits.
