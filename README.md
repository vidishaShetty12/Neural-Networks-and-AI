#### This code effectively simulates a basic McCulloch-Pitts neuron, showing how it processes input and generates a binary output based on the given threshold and weights. This forms a fundamental part of neural network computations

## Learning Rates Decay and Hyperparameters
#### Implementing a mini-batch approach for training a machine learning model involves processing a subset of the training dataset in each iteration of the training process. This approach balances the computational efficiency of batch gradient descent (where the batch contains the entire dataset) and the update frequency of stochastic gradient descent (where the batch size is one). Mini-batch gradient descent is widely used in practice due to its efficient use of hardware resources and its ability to provide a good compromise between the speed of convergence and the stability of the learning process.

#### Let's go through a basic implementation of a mini-batch approach. I'll use Python and PyTorch, a popular machine learning library that provides tools for deep learning. If you're interested in using a different library or have specific requirements, let me know!

#### The following steps outline how to implement a mini-batch approach:

#### Prepare the Data: Load the dataset and divide it into mini-batches.
#### Define the Model: Create a machine learning model that you wish to train.
#### Define the Loss Function: Choose a loss function that will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
#### Define the Optimizer: Select an optimizer that will update the model's weights based on the gradients of the loss function.
#### Train the Model: Use the mini-batches to train the model in iterations.
