## Brain, Neurons, and Models
#### This code effectively simulates a basic McCulloch-Pitts neuron, showing how it processes input and generates a binary output based on the given threshold and weights. This forms a fundamental part of neural network computations

## Convolutional Layers
#### The implementation provided above defines a function, convolve2d, which performs a 2D convolution operation on an input image using a specified kernel (also known as a filter). The convolution is applied without padding (no extra border pixels are added to the image) and without striding (the filter moves one pixel at a time).
