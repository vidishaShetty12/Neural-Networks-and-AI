## Brain, Neurons, and Models
#### This code effectively simulates a basic McCulloch-Pitts neuron, showing how it processes input and generates a binary output based on the given threshold and weights. This forms a fundamental part of neural network computations

## Normalization and Optimization Methods
#### Input normalization is a crucial step in preparing data for a neural network. It helps in speeding up the training process and reaching convergence faster by ensuring that the input features have similar scales. This can be particularly important in networks dealing with high-dimensional data, where some features might have vastly different scales than others, potentially leading to inefficient training dynamics. Here's a simple Python implementation that demonstrates how to perform input normalization for a neural network using a common library like NumPy.
